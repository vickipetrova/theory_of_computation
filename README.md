# Theory of Computation
Projects I completed in the field of Theory of Computation as part of my CS142 class. 

## CS142 Final
A summary and analysis of a recent research paper related to Theory of Computation. I completed this a s a group project with a team of 4.  The topic was "More concise representation of regular languages by automata and regular expressions".

## Complexity 
A problem set solution document that focuses on time complexity, and the Classes P and NP. 

## Computability
A problem set solution document that focuses on Turing-machines and computability.

## Working with Languages
A problem set solution document that focuses on regular and context-free languages and their associated finite state automata.
